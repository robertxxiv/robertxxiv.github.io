Privacy Policy

Last updated: 22.08.2025

I (“I,” “me,” or “the developer”) respect your privacy and am committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how I handle data when you use my projects, applications, or related services (collectively, the “Services”). Since this is a personal, non-profit project, I only collect and process the minimum information necessary to make the Services work.

1. Information I Collect

Personal Information (only if you provide it): e.g., your email address if you contact me directly.

Technical Information: such as IP address, browser type, operating system, and usage data, which may be automatically collected by hosting providers or analytics tools.

Cookies: some Services may use cookies or similar technologies for basic functionality (not for tracking or advertising).

2. How I Use Your Information

I use collected information solely to:

Provide and maintain the Services.

Respond to your inquiries if you contact me.

Improve functionality and fix bugs.
I do not use your data for marketing, profiling, or commercial purposes.

3. Sharing of Information

I do not sell or rent your information. Data may only be shared with:

Service providers/hosting platforms (e.g., GitHub, Netlify, or cloud providers) as necessary to run the Services.

Legal authorities if required by law.

4. Data Retention

I keep your data only for as long as needed to operate the Services or to comply with legal obligations.

5. Your Rights

If you are in the EU/EEA or other jurisdictions with data protection laws, you may have rights to:

Access, correct, or delete your personal data.

Restrict or object to certain processing.

Withdraw consent at any time (where applicable).

To exercise these rights, please contact me at the email below.

6. Security

I take reasonable steps to protect your data, but please note that no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

7. Children’s Privacy

My Services are not intended for children under 13 (or the age required by your jurisdiction). I do not knowingly collect data from children.

8. Changes to This Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Updates will be posted with a new “Last updated” date.
